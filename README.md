MODULE 1 - VIDEO 1

In this lesson, I learned how tracing in LangChain helps monitor and debug language model applications by providing visibility into runs with metadata for better organization. I also practiced enabling tracing through environment variables.

enabled tracing,  
added metadata,                                                                                                                               
changed the 1st question to "What does @traceable do in LangSmith"

MODULE 1 - VIDEO 2

I learned that assigning specific run types in LangSmith makes LangChain outputs easier to interpret. i learned about various run types like llm,chain,retriever,tool, I also learned about reducing chunks using reduce_fn function.
